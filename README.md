![Coffee Essence](/img/Coffee_Essence.png)

A simple website made to simplify the theme customization process within Luck be a landlord, with live-preview and export file (Not yet implemented).

Feedback are welcome.

## FEATURE
- The main game customization screen
- The item & symbols customization screen

## How do I see the colors I already set?

Not yet implemented but you can install the vue developer extension, open the project with the extension enabled, go to the App props and copy the colors_3 object

Or you can wait till I implemented it lol.
